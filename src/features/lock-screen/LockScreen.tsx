/**
 * macOS-style lock screen. Visually identical to the inline splash in
 * `index.html` (same `/wallpaper.jpg`, same dim overlay, same date/time
 * layout) so the handoff from "instant inline paint" to "React-owned overlay"
 * is invisible to the user.
 *
 * Click anywhere → calls `onUnlock()`. The fade-out + lift transition is
 * driven by a CSS `transition` triggered by the `exiting` flag we set on
 * click. The component unmounts itself only after the CSS transition has
 * actually finished, by listening for the outer `onTransitionEnd` (filtered
 * to the `opacity` property so it fires once even though we transition
 * opacity/transform/filter together). A `setTimeout(EXIT_MS + 120ms)`
 * serves as a defensive fallback for environments where transitionend
 * doesn't fire — tab backgrounded, prefers-reduced-motion CSS overrides,
 * etc. — so the user is never stuck on the lock screen.
 *
 * Why not just `setTimeout(onUnlock, EXIT_MS)` (the previous implementation):
 * if React's commit cycle is busy (the SVG Liquid Glass filter chain takes
 * a measurable amount of work to apply), the CSS transition can start a
 * frame or two after the timer was scheduled, which clips the tail end of
 * the fade. transitionend is anchored to the actual transition lifecycle
 * and so is robust against that.
 *
 * We use a plain <div> (not motion.div) for the outer wrapper because
 * framer-motion's motion.div was eating the click event in this layout.

        Liquid Glass clock — Apple iOS 26 / macOS Tahoe 26 behavior,
        applied to the Figma `8007:1666` glyph geometry (SF Pro Display
        Semibold, plus the locked-in `lockscreen-glyph-round` corner
        softening that sits between Display and Rounded).

        The static Figma vector at `8007:1666` has no effects on it (just
        `white` @ `fill-opacity=0.3`), but on real iOS 26 / macOS Tahoe
        hardware the clock reads as glass because the wallpaper *behind*
        the digits is refracted/softened through the translucent slab,
        and a dual rim of specular highlights catches the simulated
        light at the inner edges. That runtime firmware behavior is what
        we reproduce here.

        Apple's Liquid Glass material is a 5-primitive recipe:
          (1) blur, (2) vibrancy, (3) refraction (per-pixel displacement —
          this is what differentiates Liquid Glass from frosted glass),
          (4) specular (on rect controls: a DUAL rim — bright at the
          inner top edge, dark at the inner bottom edge), (5) tint.
        Sources: apple.com/newsroom/2025/06 (announcement), HIG "Adopting
        Liquid Glass", and the 9st.me deep teardown of the web-side
        recreation.

        We implement 4 of the 5 verbatim. For the specular layer, we
        ship a SOFTENED single (top-only) inner halo instead of the
        full dual rim. The dual rim was tried and rejected: on rect
        controls it's correct because the rim has horizontal real
        estate to blend across, but on text strokes that are only
        20–30px tall the bright-top + clear-body + dark-bottom triple
        gets crammed into a few pixels of vertical space and reads as
        three stacked layers rather than one cohesive surface — exactly
        the "layering" the user pushed back on. A soft single top halo
        gives the digits a defined edge without inducing the stacked-
        bands artifact.

        REJECTED EXPERIMENTS (do not re-introduce without checking
        with the user — each was tried and pulled):
         - Dual inner rim (bright top + dark bottom): stacked-bands
           artifact on narrow strokes.
         - feSpecularLighting + outer drop-shadow: read as a
           heavy-handed embossed/painted effect; user "wtf undo".
         - Painted vertical gradient via background-clip: text:
           reads as a decal, not glass.
         - Multiple stacked drop-shadows: rejected twice, character
           was painted/heavy.

        Single-source-of-truth rendering: one `<text>` element with two
        chained filters. The outer `<g>` filter (`lockscreen-liquid-glass`)
        does refraction + specular + tint; the inner `<text>` filter
        (`lockscreen-glyph-round`) does the corner softening. Because
        there's only ONE `<text>` element on screen, there is no glyph
        alignment to manage between separately-rasterized engines (the
        earlier `clipPath`-driven approach kept showing a "ghost" of the
        wallpaper refraction shifted vertically off the visible glyphs
        because Chromium's SVG text baseline metrics differ from HTML's
        line-box metrics). Chained-filter semantics: the outer filter's
        SourceAlpha is the alpha *output* of the inner filter, so the
        glass shape inherits the rounded corners by construction.

        Filter pipeline (`lockscreen-liquid-glass`, viewport-sized region):
          1. `<feImage href="/wallpaper.jpg">` — same-origin direct fetch
             of the raw wallpaper, positioned at the SVG's negative
             viewport offset (see `useViewportRefraction`) with
             `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"` — the SVG-attribute
             equivalent of CSS `background-size: cover` +
             `background-position: center`. The result lines up with the
             CSS background the user actually sees behind the clock.
          2. `feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="5"` — softens the wallpaper
             behind the glass without erasing it (#1 in Apple's recipe).
             Heavy blur (~22px) is correct for *frosted* glass like
             Apple's older sidebars/popovers; for the lock-screen
             clock, which is the see-through Liquid Glass treatment,
             the blur stays very light so wallpaper colors and shapes
             remain clearly readable through the digits. ≤2 reads as
             undistorted (no glass character); ≥10 starts to smear the
             wallpaper and the "see what's behind" character fades.
          3. `feColorMatrix type="saturate" 1.6` — vibrancy primitive
             (#2 in Apple's recipe). Keeps tinted wallpapers from going
             gray when blurred.
          4. `feColorMatrix * 0.85` — dim multiplier that compensates
             for `<feImage>` bypassing the lock-screen's CSS dim overlay
             (`linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.35), rgba(0,0,0,0.45))`).
             A pure dim-match would be ~0.676 (`(1 − 0.36) × 1.04`); we
             over-shoot to 0.85 so the wallpaper through the lens reads
             noticeably brighter than the dim-overlay'd wallpaper
             around it ("light pickup" lens character). 1.0 would
             remove the compensation entirely and the patch would
             glow; 0.72 (the prior value) reads slightly darker than
             surrounding wallpaper at the current 0.04 wash level.
          5. `feTurbulence` + `feDisplacementMap` — REFRACTION primitive
             (#3, the differentiator from frosted glass). Generates
             low-frequency fractal noise in viewport space and uses it
             to displace the lightly-blurred wallpaper, producing
             organic per-pixel "lensing" instead of just smoothing.
             Scale 6 paired with the 5px blur — scale should track the
             blur (sharper input → smaller scale, otherwise the
             displacement looks choppy). baseFrequency 0.014 gives
             noise features ~70px wide — wide enough that within any
             single glyph stroke the wallpaper appears coherently bent
             rather than choppy.
          6. `feComposite in2="SourceAlpha" operator="in"` — clip the
             refracted wallpaper to the corner-softened glyph alpha
             (SourceAlpha is the alpha output of the inner
             `lockscreen-glyph-round` filter — chained filters compose).
          7. TINT (#5): `feFlood` white + `feComposite in SourceAlpha`
             at floodOpacity 0.02. Almost entirely clear — only the
             faintest milky trace remains. The soft top halo carries
             the silhouette and the trace tint keeps the body from
             feeling hollow. Range that still works: 0.01–0.06.
             0 reads as outlined glyphs (no body at all); 0.10+ starts
             to feel painted again.
          8. SPECULAR top halo (#4, softened): `feOffset` SourceAlpha
             down by 1.5px, then `feComposite operator="out"` against
             the original alpha — gives the topmost ~1.5px sliver of
             every stroke (where stuff above is empty). `feGaussianBlur
             stdDeviation="1.2"` feathers the sliver into a soft halo,
             then flood white at opacity 0.55 and clip. The feather
             matters: a sharp 0.6px blur at high opacity reads as a
             distinct band floating above the body; a soft 1.2px blur
             at moderate opacity reads as the body itself catching
             light at the top edge. The bottom-rim shadow that pairs
             with this on rect controls is intentionally omitted (see
             header comment).
          9. `feMerge` order: refracted bg → wash → top halo. Halo
             must be last so it's not washed out by the tint.

        Do NOT re-introduce the painted vertical gradient, outer
        drop-shadow stacks, or the dual top-bright/bottom-dark rim
        — all three were tried and rejected. Refraction carries the
        glass character; the soft top halo carries edge definition;
        the trace white wash keeps the body from feeling hollow.
